PDX Web &amp; Design Site

## Initial Build Notes

This first draft is based on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) with the addition of the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) `.less` files in order to alter Bootstrap variables. I threw a Google Font reference in as a starter as well.

### Needed

1. Logo: I did almost no styling as the logo should lead the coloration and style of the site. I can do more there when we have some direction on the visual design.

2. Content, content, content: I could use guidance on all the bits that should be here. Are there sections missing? Should the organization be different? You can fork and issue a pull request to do it yourself, or just send it to [me](https://github.com/mckelvey).

3. Google Analytics: I can setup an account if desired, or perhaps you should Eric?

### Required Software

The only thing you need is the ability to compile `.less` into `.css` in order to make design updates. I used node+npm+lessc and a [simple less watching script](https://github.com/jonycheung/Dead-Simple-LESS-Watch-Compiler) as a helper, but use whatever you like to do the compilation. :)
